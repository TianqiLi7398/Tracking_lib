# Tracking_lib
Comprehensive (hopefully) implementation on different tracking algorithms

As an temporal user of the tracking algorithms (signe/ multiple traget tracking), I struggled by the poor details about the algorithms in all sorts of materials, and I believe I'm not the only one. Hereby I created this repo for implement some common target tracking algorithms (PDA, JPDA, ...) with some comprehensive example, and hope this could inspire other people learning them :)

Still under construction.
